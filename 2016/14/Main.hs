-- my 62nd one-time pad key was the one that is actually the 64th
-- (did binary search with submissions since it says high/low and I have some
-- good candidates)
-- so it seems like there are two hashes that I am not finding.

-- same deal for part 2. the 61st key was the winner
-- .. oh yeah and it takes 2Â½ minutes to run.
