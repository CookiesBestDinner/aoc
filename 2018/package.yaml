# uhm so I confused ghcide by having multiple executables and it seems
# generally nicer in general to have a Main with a switch in it for what to
# start. But I don't have that yet so... I'll just leave this as a mess!
executables:
  # 3:
  #   main: main.hs
  #   source-dirs: '3'
  # 7:
  #   main: main.hs
  #   source-dirs: '7'
  # 1:
  #   main: main.hs
  #   source-dirs: '1'
  24:
    main: main.hs
    source-dirs: '24'
